# Azure Environment Setup

### Overview

This section establishes the Azure environment used across the Azure Security Lab. It provides the foundational infrastructure for logging, monitoring, and security detection using Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Cloud.

The environment supports:

- centralised logging
- cloud security monitoring
- endpoint telemetry collection
- threat detection
- incident response workflows
- future attack simulation scenarios

This setup serves as the base platform for the Sentinel SOC, Defender for Cloud monitoring, identity security testing, and incident response labs contained in this repository.

## Objectives

This lab focuses on:

- Configuring foundational Azure security resources
- Deploying and configuring Log Analytics Workspace
- Enabling Microsoft Sentinel for SIEM monitoring
- Connecting Azure Virtual Machine telemetry
- Integrating security data connectors
- Configuring Windows logging and auditing
- Validating telemetry ingestion using KQL
- Preparing the environment for future detection engineering and threat hunting labs
